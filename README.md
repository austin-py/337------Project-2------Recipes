All of our code are in the 'src' folder, and 'Data' folder is for our data and result.

Files to run: 
    - 'user_interface.py' in the 'src' folder is the only file we need to run for our program. Upon running the program, you will be asked to give an allrecipe url. After that, the program will show a list of transformation for the recipe: to vegetarian, from vegetarian, to healthy, from healthy, to Asian, scaling and dairy free. The user will have to choose one of these options and the program will return the transformed recipe.




Dependencies: 
    - We used a number of python packages within our code. These requirements can be found in requirements.txt and can 
    be installed using "pip3 install -r requirements.txt". On some systems this might just be "pip install -r 
    requirements.txt" but we found that for our laptops it was pip3. 
    - We were using the latest version of pip.
